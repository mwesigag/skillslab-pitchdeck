Complaining rely on capacities of college and universities graduate, students and interns. Unskilled with no creativity rather daring spirit to innovation regardless spending many years in formal education thus, problem solving has become a problem itself. Similarly, for instance; Africa alone has 44 million (SMEs), and Asia has over 71 million MSMEs (according to ADB but they have no special avenue for exchange skills, knowledge, marketing and technology despite the existence of social media and other online platforms. Addition skills Lab will be the avenue for NGOs, government institutions in exchange knowledge and skills according to the arrangement of our system.
